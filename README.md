* Cross-Platform (Windows, Linux & macOS).

## Installation

### Install release binaries (Without Go Installed)

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/hueristiq/xsubfind3r/releases) and find the appropriate archive for your operating system and architecture. Download the archive from your browser or copy its URL and retrieve it with `wget` or `curl`:

* ...with `wget`:

	```bash
	wget https://github.com/hueristiq/xsubfind3r/releases/download/v<version>/xsubfind3r-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
	```

* ...or, with `curl`:

	```bash
	curl -OL https://github.com/hueristiq/xsubfind3r/releases/download/v<version>/xsubfind3r-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
	```

...then, extract the binary:

```bash
tar xf xsubfind3r-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

> **TIP:** The above steps, download and extract, can be combined into a single step with this onliner
> 
> ```bash
> curl -sL https://github.com/hueristiq/xsubfind3r/releases/download/v<version>/xsubfind3r-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar -xzv
> ```

**NOTE:** On Windows systems, you should be able to double-click the zip archive to extract the `xsubfind3r` executable.

...move the `xsubfind3r` binary to somewhere in your `PATH`. For example, on GNU/Linux and OS X systems:

```bash
sudo mv xsubfind3r /usr/local/bin/
```

**NOTE:** Windows users can follow [How to: Add Tool Locations to the PATH Environment Variable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ee537574(v=office.14).aspx) in order to add `xsubfind3r` to their `PATH`.

### Install source (With Go Installed)

Before you install from source, you need to make sure that Go is installed on your system. You can install Go by following the official instructions for your operating system. For this, we will assume that Go is already installed.

#### `go install ...`

```bash
go install -v github.com/hueristiq/xsubfind3r/cmd/xsubfind3r@latest
```

#### `go build ...` the development Version

* Clone the repository

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/hueristiq/xsubfind3r.git 
	```

* Build the utility

	```bash
	cd xsubfind3r/cmd/xsubfind3r && \
	go build .
	```

* Move the `xsubfind3r` binary to somewhere in your `PATH`. For example, on GNU/Linux and OS X systems:

	```bash
	sudo mv xsubfind3r /usr/local/bin/
	```

	**NOTE:** Windows users can follow [How to: Add Tool Locations to the PATH Environment Variable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ee537574(v=office.14).aspx) in order to add `xsubfind3r` to their `PATH`.


**NOTE:** While the development version is a good way to take a peek at `xsubfind3r`'s latest features before they get released, be aware that it may have bugs. Officially released versions will generally be more stable.

## Post Installation

`xsubfind3r` will work right after [installation](#installation). However, **[BeVigil](https://bevigil.com)**, **[BufferOver](https://tls.bufferover.run/)**, **[BuiltWith](https://api.builtwith.com/domain-api)**, **[Certspotter](https://sslmate.com/ct_search_api/)**, **[Chaos](https://chaos.hueristiq.io/#/)**, **[Fullhunt](https://fullhunt.io/)**, **[Github](https://github.com)**, **[Intelligence X](https://intelx.io)**, **[LeakIX](https://leakix.net)** and **[Shodan](https://shodan.io/)** require API keys to work, **[URLScan](https://urlscan.io)** supports API key but not required. The API keys are stored in the `$HOME/.config/xsubfind3r/config.yaml` file - created upon first run - and uses the YAML format. Multiple API keys can be specified for each of these source from which one of them will be used.
